# Image Colorisation using CNN

Coloring black and white images using a very simple structure of CNN in tensorflow.

## Overview

### Todo

- [x] Overfit the model on a single image to check implementation
- [x] Write a script to make and use TFRecords for efficient GPU training
- [ ] Train the model on a dataset for coloring human portraits
- [ ] Use a trained model (Inceptionv3 or ResNet) as a feature extractor for better results
- [ ] Train the model to color any random image

### A simple structure of CNN, as described by the image below was trained from scratch.

Currently, the model is trained for only human portraits.
